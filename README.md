A (semi) realistic chomping progress view that takes bites out of your delicious images! Nom! Nom!

* Increment progress.
* Change bite size.
* Select a bite direction or just take random(ish) bites.  
* (semi) realistic bites taken from images set in the view (use an image with a transparent background for best effect)

### Setup
To use **ChompProgressView** in your projects, simply add the library as a dependency to your build.

##### Gradle
```
dependencies {
  compile 'uk.co.barbuzz:chompprogressview:0.0.2'
}
```

##### Maven
```
<dependency>
  <groupId>uk.co.barbuzz.chompprogressview</groupId>
  <artifactId>chompprogressview</artifactId>
  <version>0.0.2</version>
  <type>pom</type>
</dependency>
```

Alternatively you can directly import the /library project into your Android Studio project and add it as a dependency in your build.gradle.

The library is currently configured to be built via Gradle only. It doesn't have any dependencies. :-)

* Compiled SDK Version      - Oreo-27
* Minimum SDK Version       - >= Lollipop-14

### Usage
For more detailed code example to use the library, Please refer to the `/sample` app.

`ChompProgressView` can be added as a custom view to any layout.

```
<uk.co.barbuzz.chompprogressview.ChompProgressView
        android:id="@+id/chompProgressView"
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        android:layout_height="match_parent"
        android:src="@drawable/pizza"
        app:biteRadius="200dp"
        app:chompProgress="0"
        app:chompMax="100"
        app:chompDirection="top"/>
```

You can then either set the xml parameters to configure the view or do it programmatically as follows.
```
ChompProgressView chompProgressView = (ChompProgressView) findViewById(R.id.chompProgressView);

chompProgressView.setImageDrawableChomp(mPizzaDrawble)
chompProgressView.setBiteRadius(400);
chompProgressView.setChompMax(100);
chompProgressView.setChompProgress(0);
```
**Remember to use the ```setImageDrawableChomp(Drawable)``` method instead of ```setImageDrawable(Drawable)``` as this stores the orginal drawable and calculates some bite information.**

The chomp direction can be changed between random bites and a specified direction as shown in the example below (```RANDOM``` is the default). This can also be set in the view attributes xml (see above).
```
mChompProgressImageView.setChompDirection(ChompProgressImageView.ChompDirection.TOP);
```

Bite radius can be set (400 is the default) in code as follows or in the view attributes xml (see above).
```
mChompProgressImageView.setBiteRadius(400);
```

You can also reset the image and progress/bites taken by calling the following method.
```
chompProgressView.removeBites();
```

### TODO
1. Improve the overall drawing of the bite
2. Make the takeBite() method of ChompProgressImageView more flexible with bite direction config

### Thanks

This library was made after a conversation while eating free pizza at the great <a href="https://www.meetup.com/swmobile/">SW Mobile Meetup</a> in Bristol UK.  Thanks for all the pizza inspiration! 

Also thanks to the <a href="https://thenounproject.com">noun project</a> for providing the pizza and lolly icons (Imogen Oh & Kristin McPeak respectively)
